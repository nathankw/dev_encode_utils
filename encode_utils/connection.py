    For data submission or modification, and working with non-released datasets, you must have
    the environment variables `DCC_API_KEY` and `DCC_SECRET_KEY` set. Check with your DCC data wrangler
    if you haven't been assigned these keys.

    There are three log files opened in append mode in the directory specified by ``connection.LOG_DIR`` that
    are specific to whichever Portal you are connected to. When connected to Production, each log file
    name will include the token '_prod_'. For Development, the token will be '_dev_'. The three
    log files are named accordingly in reference to their purpose, and are classified as:

    1. debug log file - All messages sent to STDOUT are also written to this log file. In addition,
       all messages written to the error log file described below are logged here.
    2. error log file - Only terse error messages are sent to this log file for quick scanning of
       any potential issues. If you identify an error here that needs more explanation, then you
       should consult the debug log file.
    3. posted log file - Tabulates what was successfully POSTED. There are three tab-delimited
       colummns ordered as submission timestamp, record alias, and record accession (or UUID if
       the `accession` property doesn't exist for the profile of the record at hand). Note that if a
       record has several aliases, then only the first one in the list for the `aliases` property is
       used.
